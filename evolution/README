Requirements: Evolution 2.6.2, LDTP (>= 0.5.0)

This directory contains the source code for the automation scripts for
Evolution 2.6. The following features of Evolution are automated:
* Mailer
* AddressBook
* Calendars
* Tasks

There are some pre-requisites for running the scripts:
For Tasks:
----------
The ``Personal'' Task list should be present.


For Calendars:
--------------
Make sure that the attendees that you have put in the
Data XML files are indeed present in the Contacs Address Book. Currently
there is a bug () which does not get the main evolution window the
active status, so it might be necessary for the window to be given the
focus (i.e. by clicking on the window) manually.

For AddressBook:
----------------
Make sure that you move the scroll bar once through the
entire window i.e. such that all the contacts come into view at least
once before you select the contacts through the script. It is unable to
select it otherwise.


For Mailer:
-----------
The Reference Images for the Image comparision tests *have* to be remade
for your environment. They will not under most possibility match with
your evironment.

The Subject, To, From fields in some of the data fields will need to be
modified to suit the environment of yours.

Make Sure that you have 1 account configured with a saved password for
an SMTP server (if it is used). An ``Enter Password'' dialog box will
not be handled.
