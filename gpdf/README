Test suite for gnome-pdf-viewer (Gnome 2.9.x)

Test case                            Prerequisite
---------                            ------------

open-pdf-file.py  		   You need to have a pdf-file called 'sample.pdf' 
                                   in the Home folder.
                                  
The test script below has the same pre-requisite, if it is to be executed alone. Else it can simply follow the open-pdf-file.py test script.

view-pdf-properties.py
